# Start Using Enoki

## What is Enoki?

Enoki is a multiplayer Linux desktop with file storage that is accessible in the browser and shareable with others. Think of it as Figma for developers. You can collaborate seamlessly on code, share files and workspaces with ease, while maintaining version control in real-time. Our intuitive interface also allows for easy onboarding and minimal training time, so your team can focus on what matters most: building great software.

## The Benefits

Enoki allows you to create custom Linux base images that correspond to a specific deliverable for your team. In other words, you can define the exact applications, APIs, SSH Keys, and VPNs for the Enoki workspace linked to that task. Similarly, you can manage team members and their permissions. What's great about the platform is each workspace is ephemeral and collaboration is asynchronous (no need to worry about hand offs or time zones!)
